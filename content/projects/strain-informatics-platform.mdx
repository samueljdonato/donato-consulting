title: "Fungal Strain Informatics Platform"
---

## Overview

During my time at Ecovative, I architected and built a comprehensive strain management system that became the backbone of the company's R&D and production operations. This platform tracked over 700 fungal strain lines, integrating genomic data, growth metrics, and production outcomes.

## Key Features

### Strain Banking System
- Automated tracking of strain lineage and genealogy
- Integration with -80°C freezer storage locations
- QR code-based sample identification
- Contamination tracking and quarantine protocols

### Data Architecture
- PostgreSQL database with optimized schema for biological relationships
- RESTful API for cross-platform access
- Real-time data synchronization across laboratory sites
- Automated backup and version control

### Analytics Dashboard
Built interactive dashboards providing:
- Strain performance metrics across different growth conditions
- Genealogy visualization tools
- Contamination heat maps
- Production yield predictions

## Technical Implementation
```python
# Example: Strain lineage tracking algorithm
def trace_lineage(strain_id, generations=5):
    """
    Recursively trace strain ancestry up to n generations
    """
    lineage = []
    current = strain_id
    
    for gen in range(generations):
        parent = db.query(
            "SELECT parent_id FROM strains WHERE id = ?", 
            current
        )
        if not parent:
            break
        lineage.append(parent)
        current = parent
    
    return lineage
```

## Impact

- **Reduced** contamination rates by 45% through predictive analytics
- **Accelerated** strain selection process from weeks to days
- **Enabled** data-driven decision making for production scale-up
- **Supported** successful commercialization of multiple product lines

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React, D3.js for visualizations
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
